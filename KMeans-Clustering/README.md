# KMeans Clustering for Yarn Selection

### Overview
#### Machine Learning Technique

KMeans clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions a dataset into 'k' clusters. One technique, and the one I used, to find the optimal 'k' is to create a visualization called an elbow graph. In this graph, the 'elbow' refers to the point where an additional number of clusters no longer notably impacts the results. 

#### Program's Purpose

This program is used to assist in the selection of yarn and yarn colors from a photo for use in various fiber arts. After uploading a photo and deciding on the number of dominant colors in an image, the dominant colors of the image, found through KMeans clustering, will be matched to the closest yarn color in the dataset. Users will then be able to compare the ‘true’ colors to the selected yarn.

### Data

This project contains three example photos that I have taken. These photos are included for the following reasons:
(1) [Stout_Blanket](https://github.com/Emily-McNett/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/main/KMeans-Clustering/Stout_Blanket.JPEG) - This photo inspired the creation of this program as I was interested in it enough to take a photograph but, when I returned to the store the blanket was sold out. I became interested in making something similar myself but didn't know where to start when purchasing the correct yarn colors.

(2) [Camping_Photo](https://github.com/Emily-McNett/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/main/KMeans-Clustering/Camping_Photo.JPEG) - This beautiful photo of my dad standing next to our tents on one of our latest bike-camping trips has a much wider variety of colors. For this image, I am less interested in making a photorealistic tapestry and more interested in capturing the general asthetic and key colors to create a personal and unique item. 

(3) [Nature_Photo](https://github.com/Emily-McNett/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/main/KMeans-Clustering/Nature_Photo.JPEG) - This image was added as a challenge to myself and the program. There are a lot of similar, earthy colors that can make clustering for dominant colors difficult. Again, however, I am not as interested in making a photorealistic item as I am with capturing the general asthetic of the colors.

This project also contains a dataset of yarn colors by brand, name, and hex code. These colors were pulled from the [Yarn Colorway Finder](https://temperature-blanket.com/). As this program was for more personal purposes, I only pulled yarn from brands that I was familiar with and would be likely to purchase from. However, all of their yarns can be found [here](https://github.com/jdvlpr/Temperature-Blanket-Web-App/tree/main/src/lib/yarns).
